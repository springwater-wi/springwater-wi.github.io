          <p>Wait for a few weeks til the August heat rolls by. And turn your direction towards Lake Michigan's clear sky. And take a trip to where the falling leaves make way to evergreens. When that lakeshore opens up you'll see how lovely it can be.</p>

          <p>Know it doesn't matter what you do. You're a flock of geese, you're only passing through. But when you take a little time to get away, know the places they will keep you all the same.</p>

          <p>So drive to Chicago in the summer, in the sun. Sing to empty living rooms and sleep on hardwood floors. Then when in three months time we're on the phone, you'll call this place your home. I'll think of moving boxes at your door and the windy city shore.</p>

          <p>Know it doesn't matter what you do. You're a flock of geese, you're only passing through. But when you take a little time to get away, chose a frosty morning cold and clear or a big bad world with all your fears and your friends will end up back home anyways. But the places they will keep you all the same.</p>

        <div id="port-city" class="lyrics" style="display: none;">
          <p>From the shores of Superior, to the sands of Michigan. The winds are blowing blind. Like the trees of the forests and the stalks of the fields the song of my mind calls home.</p>

          <p>Father was silent with every shaking breath until they ended with no restart. Mother was weeping with tears down her face. And the song of my heart calls home.</p>

          <p>We stood near the water with chests seizing tight. We took you to rest. With hands held together and knuckles pulled white, we watched you float away.</p>

          <p>On the shores of Superior I can feel you far away like a long lost winter dream. In the fields of our father I can feel you flowing by and the song of your soul calls me home.</p>

        <div id="blessing" class="lyrics" style="display: none;">
          <p>May your maps take you straight, may your compass ever hold true<br>
          May your travels lead you far but always bring you home<br>
          And if the wind falls out of your sails, may your God be there to pick it up again<br>
          May the weight of the world never sink your little boat</p>

          <p>May you find yourself a house, may you open all the windows<br>
          May the morning find you early, drinking coffee on your porch<br>
          And in September, when your family is bigger, may you find the time to walk your kids to school<br>
          May you take them to the ocean and the city, may you send them to play out in the woods</p>

          <p>And I pray I'm not the only one to bless you on this journey<br>
          May you take all of these thoughts and fill your heart up to the brim<br>
          I hope it fills so much it spills<br>
          So when the day comes that you leave someone,<br>
          You'll bless them all the same</p>

          <p>When your five foot shoulders lay six feet under, may the people you know, may they all find their peace<br>
          When the day ends and the shadows lengthen, may they learn to sing your songs and speak your words<br>
          May they recognize your blessedness, may they know that you have left them just this way</p>

        <div id="winter-lullaby" class="lyrics" style="display: none;">
          <p>Darlin, oh darlin it's starting to snow, but I promise I'll stay awhile. Darlin, oh darlin, the seasons come and go, like a simple turn of the screw.</p>

          <p>Although outside it's windy and white, although the darkness is long. You can stay in my arms until morning is light. And let this winter lullaby keep you warm.</p>

          <p>Darlin, oh darlin, remember summertime? And the foolish things we did. Darlin, oh darlin we'll stay up all night and imagine the foolish things we'll do.</p>

          <p>And I know outside the cold and wind can burn. it's hard to leave the comfort of the warm. But we'll go outside and be the kids we always were. Let this winter lullaby keep you warm.</p>
